# ascii-encoding
This repo is aimed at developing a video to monochrome ascii encoder, written in rust. I know nothing about ascii encoding or rust, so let's see how it goes!. BTW, im planning on using this for a M A T R I X kind of rave, I want to use this on all the VJ output. If you want to buy tickets, keep an eye on https://under-pass.com/events
